# The container the cluster runs (ADR-0003, ADR-0004).
#
# Three things it has to be, and each one is a decision rather than boilerplate:
#
#   1. **It must build with no database.** `pnpm build` already works with `DATABASE_URL`
#      unset, because every page that reads the library is `force-dynamic` and reads it per
#      request — so nothing here passes a connection string as a build argument, and
#      nothing should. A build that needed a database would need one in CI, in a registry
#      job and on a laptop, and the first thing anybody would reach for is a copy of the
#      owner's own.
#
#      It does need **the network**, and only for the faces: `next/font/google` fetches the
#      three families in `src/app/layout.tsx` and self-hosts them, so the owner's browser
#      asks Google for nothing at run time. `next build` fails outright when it cannot reach
#      them — deliberately, because an image that silently shipped fallback type would look
#      wrong everywhere and say so nowhere.
#   2. **It must not run as root.** The image ships with `USER node`, and
#      `apps/tsundoku/deployment.yaml` in the cluster repo says so again as a
#      `securityContext`. Twice on purpose: the image is what makes it true anywhere it is
#      run, and the manifest is what refuses to schedule it if it ever stops being true.
#   3. **It must carry the migrations.** The deployment runs them from this same image
#      before the app is allowed to serve, so what is applied is exactly what was built.
#      `db/` is therefore copied into the runtime stage on purpose, next to the traced
#      server rather than into it.
#
# `output: "standalone"` in `next.config.ts` is the other half of this file: it traces what
# the server actually imports and writes a self-contained server, so the last stage is node
# plus that directory instead of node plus every dependency in the lockfile.

# The version mise pins for development, so what is built here is what was tested there.

# Corepack reads `packageManager` from package.json, so the pnpm version is the lockfile's
# and not whatever the image happens to ship.

# The migration runner is not part of what `standalone` traces. `db/cli.ts migrate` is run
# by node directly — that is the whole point of decision 3 below — so it resolves its
# imports from `node_modules` at runtime rather than from the traced bundle. It needs `pg`,
# which the server imports too and which is therefore traced, and `drizzle-orm`, which is
# not: Next bundles Drizzle's code into the server's own chunks and leaves no package
# behind for anything else to import.
#
# So the one package is staged here explicitly. `cp -RL` because pnpm's `node_modules` entry
# is a symlink into `.pnpm/`, and the runtime stage has no store to point at. It is
# self-contained: `drizzle-orm` declares no runtime dependencies of its own.

# the press that loads it is made in a shop and a third party on that path is one more name to
# resolve and one more thing to be blocked. Missing here, the scanner would work in Chrome and
