// The owner gate's verdict, as a pure function of the environment and one session.
//
// The gate exists at two levels: `src/proxy.ts` redirects, and `requireOwner()`
// refuses. The proxy is ergonomics, the assert is the wall — but the two must never
// disagree about *who the owner is*, so both of them ask this module and nothing
// else. It is deliberately pure: no `process.env` read, no Auth.js import, no I/O.
// That is what makes the fail-closed behaviour a table of cases rather than an
// argument, and it is why the ticket's "both directions" costs one test file.
//
// Nothing here is domain vocabulary. *Owner*, *gate* and *session* are
// infrastructure, not the language of the library, which is why `CONTEXT.md` carries
// none of these words.

 * How long a session lives, counted from the sign-in that opened it: **90 days,

 * the session is resolved and appends the resulting `Set-Cookie` to the response, so
 * `maxAge` alone is not "how long the session lasts" but "how long the app can go
 * unopened" — open the app once a month and the cookie never expires. That is a
 * session silently refreshing into a longer life than intended, which this slice's
 * ticket rules out, so the moment the gate was opened is stamped into the token at
 * sign-in and the life is measured from there. Nothing moves it forward; only a new
 * sign-in, which is a deliberate act and a round trip to Google, opens a new one.
 *
 * 90 days because the library is used phone-in-hand in a shop and being logged out
 * at the till is the failure that matters. The cookie's own `maxAge` is set to the
