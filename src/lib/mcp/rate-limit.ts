// What stands in front of the bearer gate.
//
// `/mcp` is the first publicly reachable service on the cluster (ADR-0004), and an
// endpoint that answers a token check to anyone who asks is an endpoint that can be asked
// forever. So the limiter runs **before** `bearerGate`, not after: a refusal that costs a
// database query, a SHA-256 or even a log line is still a refusal somebody can buy
// millions of.
//
// Shaped like `./bearer.ts` and `@/lib/auth/gate.ts`: a **predicate** the route handler
// asks for a verdict, which knows nothing about status codes or headers. It differs from
// both in the one way it has to — it remembers — and `now` is therefore a parameter rather
// than a clock, which is what keeps the arithmetic a table of cases in
// `rate-limit.test.ts`.
//
// ## Two windows, and why the second one exists
//
// **Per client**, so one caller cannot occupy the door; and **over the whole door**, so a
// caller who rotates addresses cannot either.
//
// The second one is there because **the first one's key is only as honest as the proxy in
// front of it**. `clientOf` below reads a header, and a header is written by whoever is
// calling; if the proxy ever stopped overwriting it, every request could arrive with a fresh
// address and its own fresh allowance. The ceiling over the whole door is what is left when
// that happens, so it is deliberately not a large number: the legitimate traffic here is one
// assistant answering one person's questions, closer to thirty a day than three hundred a
// minute.
//
// A request already refused by its own allowance is **not** charged to the door, so an
// address hammering the endpoint spends thirty of the ceiling and not three hundred.
// **The remaining trade is real and worth naming**: a flood spread across enough addresses
// can still fill the ceiling, and while it does, the owner's own assistant is refused too.
// That is accepted. It clears in a minute, and the alternative to refusing the owner for a
// minute is not refusing the flood.
//
// What none of this is, is a defence of the token. A 256-bit bearer is not brute-forced at
// three hundred guesses a minute or at three hundred million; the limit is here so that
// trying costs this endpoint nothing, not so that trying fails.
//
// ## The state is in this process, and that is an assumption
//
// One `Map`, in memory, for the life of the container. **It assumes one replica**, which
// is what `apps/tsundoku/deployment.yaml` in the cluster repo deploys and what the single
// node it runs on affords anyway. Two replicas would each hold their own counters and the
// effective limits would double — wrong, but wrong in the safe direction, and loudly so.
// Anything sharing this across replicas means a Redis this app does not have and does not
// want; the honest fix if a second replica is ever wanted is to say so here first.
//
// A restart forgets the counters. That is a real hole and a small one: a deploy is a
// deliberate act by the owner, and the door reopens with a fresh window rather than
// forgiving anything already refused.
