// instead of an error; the thing that actually refuses is `requireOwner()`, for the
// reasons written down beside it.
//
// Everything below asks `@/lib/auth/gate` for the verdict, exactly as the wall does.
// Two layers, one predicate — so they cannot come to different conclusions about who
// the owner is or about how long a session lives.

// The development gate is answered *before* Auth.js is touched. That is not an
// optimisation: with the flag on there is no `AUTH_SECRET` and no Google client to
// resolve a session against, which is what lets the local loop in the README run with
// nothing hosted and no human step.

  //   - **`signin`**, the one screen a non-owner may see.
  //   - **`mcp`**, the other door. It is authenticated by a static bearer rather than
  //     by Google (ADR-0004), and a redirect to a Google consent screen is not an
  //     answer an assistant can read. Reserved here so the slice that builds it does
  //     not have to edit this line.
  //   - **the build output and the favicon**, which the browser fetches unprompted and
  //     **without credentials**.
  //
  // All three named paths are anchored to a path boundary. Unanchored they would also
  // excuse anything merely *starting* with those letters — `/api/authors`, `/mcp-token`
  // — which is a wider hole than the reservation: the exclusion is for three paths,
  // not for three prefixes.
