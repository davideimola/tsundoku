// instead of an error; the thing that actually refuses is `requireOwner()`, for the
// reasons written down beside it.
//
// Everything below asks `@/lib/auth/gate` for the verdict, exactly as the wall does.
// Two layers, one predicate — so they cannot come to different conclusions about who
// the owner is or about how long a session lives.

// The development gate is answered *before* Auth.js is touched. That is not an
// optimisation: with the flag on there is no `AUTH_SECRET` and no Google client to
// resolve a session against, which is what lets the local loop in the README run with
// nothing hosted and no human step.

  // Everything is gated except five things, and each of them is load-bearing:
  //
  //   - **`api/auth`**, Auth.js's own endpoints. A gated sign-in endpoint is a gate
  //     that can never be opened.
  //   - **`signin`**, the one screen a non-owner may see.
  //   - **`mcp`**, the other door. It is authenticated by a static bearer rather than
  //     by Google (ADR-0004), and a redirect to a Google consent screen is not an
  //     answer an assistant can read. Reserved here so the slice that builds it does
  //     not have to edit this line.
  //   - **`api/showcase`**, the third door's first resource, for the same reason and
  //     **named rather than prefixed** (ADR-0025). `/api` is deliberately not excluded
  //     as a whole: `api/auth` already lives under it, and a prefix-wide hole is one
  //     every later route falls into without anybody deciding it should. A route added
  //     under `/api` and left out of this line is gated by Google and answers
  //     `307 /signin` to its bearer, which is wrong in the safe direction and loudly
  //     so. The thing that actually refuses on that door is `requireApiCaller()`, and
  //     `src/app/api/gated.test.ts` fails when a route stops calling it.
  //   - **`.well-known`**, the prefix RFC 8615 reserves for metadata a machine fetches
  //     *before* it has any credentials to fetch it with. Gating it does not protect
  //     anything — nothing is served under it — and it actively breaks the clients it
  //     is meant to answer: an `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` that replies
  //     `307 /signin` tells a discovery probe nothing, where a `404` correctly says
  //     "this server publishes none". A cross-origin redirect is also refused outright
  //     by well-behaved probes, which is how this was found — `tunnel-client` reported
  //     the gate's redirect as `redirect blocked: destination must use the discovery
  //     origin`, and stayed unready.
  //   - **the build output and the favicon**, which the browser fetches unprompted and
  //     **without credentials**.
  //   - **the icons and the manifest**, for exactly that last reason and no new one.
  //     `icon.svg`, `icon1` — the favicon's raster twin, which is the one Safari can see —
  //     `apple-icon` and `manifest.webmanifest` are fetched by a browser and by an operating
  //     system, and a manifest is fetched with credentials *omitted* unless the link asks
  //     otherwise — so gated they answer `307 /signin`, and the phone silently never offers
  //     to install the app or draws a generic tile. Nothing under them is library data: an
  //     application's name and its logo are already on the sign-in screen.
  //
  // Every named path is anchored to a path boundary. Unanchored they would also excuse
  // anything merely *starting* with those letters — `/api/authors`, `/mcp-token`,
  // `/.well-known-ish`, `/icon.svg.map` — which is a wider hole than the reservation: the
  // exclusion is for these paths, not for these prefixes.
